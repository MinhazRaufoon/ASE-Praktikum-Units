What is ECU?
	ECU means electronic control unit. It's an embedded system which controls one or more electronic subsystems in a vehicle. ECU integrates the following functions - analysis of sensor data, calculations, and controlling the actuators.

Why is ECU an Embedded System?
	- ECU has a specific purpose, it controls the electronic subsystems of a vehicle
	- ECU has strict restrictions on cost, performance, size etc.
	- ECUs can be a part of a bigger System

Name some ECUs in a Car
	ACC - Adaptive Cruise Control
	ESP - Electronic Stability Program
	ABS - antilock braking system
	ECM - engine control module

Embedded System - computer with special purpose

Distributed System - computers in a network which communicates by messages

interactive system - 
	a system of hardware and software components which process user inputs and returns result

reactive system - 
	a system of hardware and software components which  interacts with the environment

realtime system - 
	a system of hardware and software components which guarantees the completion of a task within a predefined deadline

Unit of a mechatronic system - sensors, actuators, ECUs

Sensor - 
	electronic device which measures a physical quantity from the environment such as temperature, pressure etc, and converts the information into an electric signal

Actuator - 
	a machine which receives electric signals from ECU and converts it into mechanical motion or any physical quantity, such as light or sound.

Requirements of a modern day ECU:
	- reliable under rough and changing ambient conditions
	- high demands to dependability, availability, security

How ECUs communicate?
	by message exchange through BUS that interconnects the ECUs

ECUs in a car are divided into the following subsystems
	Engine
	chassis
	body
	multimedia
	security
