velocity of the car used in
	ESC - electronic stability control
	ABS - antilock breaking system
	ACC - adaptive cruise control

advantages of bus systems over traditional p2p communication:
	multiple use of signals
	reduction of cost, weight, installation space
	improved reliability, security, maintainability
	easy connection of other system components
	simplification of the vehicle assembly

Highspeed CAN (CAN-C):
	ISO 11898-2
	high data rate
	short latency
	125K-1MBPS
	motor management, engine controlling, car stability systems

Lowspeed CAN (CAN-B)
	ISO 11898-3
	upto 125KBPS
	comfort and vehicle body area

Functions of Data Link Layer:
	addressing
	message definition
	bus access
	synchronization
	failure management

Types of messages in CAN bus system:
	Data Frame: 
		data sent by a participant
	Remote Frame: 
		data frame for remote transmission request
		request data from a specific participant in the network
	Error Frame:
		show errors in the network
	Overload Frame:
		forced delay between remote and data frame


CAN2.0A:
	1bit - SOF
	11bit - ID ------------------ 29bit for CAN2.0B
	7bit - control ------------------ 9bit for CAN2.0B
	0-64bit - Data
	16bit - CRC
	2bit - ACK
	7bit - EOF	

Function of control bits:
	if message is remote frame
	which format used
	data length


Bit fault vs Ack Fault

Components for CAN communication:
	CPU
	CAN controller
	CAN transceiver

Functions of CAN transceiver:
	implements physical layer
	transforms bitstream of CAN controller to voltage levels, vice versa

Functions of CAN controller:
	implements data link layer

Components of CAN controller:
	Sending & receiving cache
	Filter components for acceptance filtering
	management unit
